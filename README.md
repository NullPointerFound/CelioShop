<h1>CelioShop is a full stack e-commerce Application </h1>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

Thank you for checking out my repository. CelioShop is a full-stack e-commerce application that I am currently working on in my free time. I am always adding new features and regularly improving it. I am creating this application for both fun and to acquire new skills. If you feel like you can contribute to it in any way, I would be happy to hear from you.

<h2> Technologies used in development </h2>

<ul>
<li> Client Side React JS ( front end developement isn't my cup of tea b but I'm pushing myself to stay up to date with current trends and keep my skills fresh ).</li>
<li> Server-side: Java SDK 18, Spring Boot, Tomcat Server, Maven Build Tools, Spring Security. ( I really enjoy using Java, and whenver I feel bored from front end I jump straight to backend just to escape from "how to center a div hell" with css to Java</li>
<li> Data access: Spring Data JPA, MySql. </li>

</ul>
